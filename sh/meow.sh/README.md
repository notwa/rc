# meow.sh

Prints out the title, torrent link, and timestamp
for every new release matching your regular expressions
and reminds you that your taste in anime is shit.

## Usage

Just take a peek at `run` and `config.sh` for now.
If you can't figure it out, you're too sane to use this.

## License

These scripts are hardly unique so
I'm not signing my name on them and
I'm not applying any license.
Just pretend they're under the [WTFPL][0]
if you really want to.
