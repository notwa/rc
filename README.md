## obligatory personal dotfiles repository

_(plus some little shell scripts)_

quick install for random boxes:

```
cd && curl -L https://github.com/notwa/rc/archive/master.tar.gz | tar zx && mv rc-master rc && rc/install
```

## shell functions

### [argc](/sh/argc#L7)

validate the number of arguments in a function.
```sh
# usage: myfunc() { argc -(eq|le|ge) [0-9] "$0" "$@" || return; }

myfunc() {
    # use one of the following:
    argc -eq N "$0" "$@" || return
    argc -le N "$0" "$@" || return
    argc -ge N "$0" "$@" || return
    # where N is an integer between 0 and 9.
}
```

### [arith](/sh/arith#L9)

perform arithmetic using the shell and display the result.
see also [`hex`](#hex) and [`bin`](#bin).
this example requires zsh:

```
% db=6
% noglob arith 10**(db/20.)
1.9952623149688795
```

### [aur](/sh/aur#L7)

download, edit, make, and install packages from the
[AUR.](https://aur.archlinux.org/)
it's a little broken.

```
$ aur -eyoI cmdpack-uips applyppf
```

### [autosync](/sh/autosync#L8)

combine `inotifywait` and `rsync`.
this is sometimes nicer than `ssh`-ing into a server and running `vim` remotely.

### [bak](/sh/bak#L6)

backup files by creating copies and appending ".bak" to their names.
this calls itself recursively to avoid clobbering existing backups.

```
$ touch -d '2001-12-25 16:30:00' butts
$ bak butts
$ touch butts
$ bak butts
$ ls -l
total 0
-rw-r--r-- 1 notwa None 0 Aug  1 08:02 butts
-rw-r--r-- 1 notwa None 0 Aug  1 08:02 butts.bak
-rw-r--r-- 1 notwa None 0 Dec 25  2001 butts.bak.bak
```

### [baknow](/sh/baknow#L4)

backup a single file by appending its timestamp given by [`now`.](#now)

```
$ touch -d '2001-12-25 16:30:00' butts
$ baknow butts
$ baknow butts
cp: overwrite 'butts.2001-12-26_01800000.bak'? n
$ ls -l
total 0
-rw-r--r-- 1 notwa None 0 Dec 25  2001 butts
-rw-r--r-- 1 notwa None 0 Dec 25  2001 butts.2001-12-26_01800000.bak
```

**TODO:** support multiple files at once.

### [baks](/sh/baks#L11)

backup files by copying each and appending *the current* date-time,
irrespective of when the files were modified or created.

```
$ touch -d '2001-12-25 16:30:00' butts
$ baks butts
$ baks butts
$ ls -l
total 0
-rw-r--r-- 1 notwa None 0 Dec 25  2001 butts
-rw-r--r-- 1 notwa None 0 Dec 25  2001 butts.21-08-01_14-54-07.bak
-rw-r--r-- 1 notwa None 0 Dec 25  2001 butts.21-08-01_14-54-09.bak
```

### [bin](/sh/bin#L9)

perform arithmetic using the shell and display the result as
an unsigned 8-bit integer in binary.
see also [`arith`](#arith) and [`hex`](#hex).

```
$ bin 123
01111011
```

### [cdbusiest](/sh/cdbusiest#L4)

$ cd
$ cdbusiest
152364 src
$ pwd
/home/notwa/src
```

### [colors](/sh/colors#L6)

display all combinations of foreground and background terminal colors.
this only includes the basic 16-color palette.
excluding boilerplate, this script is a mere a 76-characters long!

![terminal colors](https://eaguru.guru/t/terminal-colors.png)

### [compandy](/sh/compandy#L5)

generate compand arguments for ffmpeg audio filters.
this is kinda pointless now that acompressor is wildly supported.

### [setup_clang_ubuntu (sh/compile)](/sh/compile#L6)

print (but don't execute) the commands necessary to install
a fairly recent version of clang on ubuntu-based distros.

```sh
$ setup_clang_ubuntu bionic
wget -O - http://apt.llvm.org/llvm-snapshot.gpg.key | apt-key add -
echo -n "deb http://apt.llvm.org/bionic/ llvm-toolchain-bionic main
# deb-src http://apt.llvm.org/bionic/ llvm-toolchain-bionic main
# 12
deb http://apt.llvm.org/bionic/ llvm-toolchain-bionic-12 main
# deb-src http://apt.llvm.org/bionic/ llvm-toolchain-bionic-12 main
" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/llvm-toolchain-bionic.list
apt-get update
apt-get install clang-12
apt-get install lld-12
update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/clang clang /usr/bin/clang-12 1200
update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/clang++ clang++ /usr/bin/clang++-12 1200

```

### [compile](/sh/compile#L49)

compile single-file C and C++ programs, messily.

supports gcc and clang on \*nix, and mingw64 gcc, msvc clang,
and regular msvc on Windows. tested on x86\_64 and on ARMv7 as well.
does not support MacOS, maybe somedayâ€¦

defaults to gnu11 and gnu++1z as C and C++ standards respectively.
defaults to clang, gcc, and msvc in that order.

`compile` attempts to guess the most sane switches for any program, so that compilation may reduce to:

```sh
# debug build
compile rd.c
compile debug rd.c
# debug build with warning/error flags defined in .-shrc
# (requires .zshrc for global alias expansion)
compile WHOA rd.c
# likewise for C++
compile WHOA WELP rd.cc
compile WHOA WELP rd.cpp
# "derelease" build (release build with debug information)
compile derelease WHOA rd.c
# release build (with symbols stripped)
compile release WHOA rd.c
# hardened build (only useful on *nix)
compile hardened WHOA rd.c
# specifying compiler
compile gcc WHOA rd.c
compile msvc WHOA rd.c
compile release clang WHOA rd.c
# compile and execute (FIXME: writing to /tmp is a security concern)
compile derelease rd.c && /tmp/rd
```

### [confirm](/sh/confirm#L6)

display a simple yes-or-no prompt and return 0-or-1 respectively.

```
$ confirm && echo yay || echo nay
Continue? [y/N] y
yay
$ confirm && echo yay || echo nay
Continue? [y/N] n
nay
```

a real world example:

```
% g1 && confirm && git commit -a --amend --no-edit
daf84e3 document a ton of stuff
Continue? [y/N] y
[master 92bdf76] document a ton of stuff
 Date: Sun Aug 1 09:27:25 2021 -0700
 20 files changed, 406 insertions(+), 29 deletions(-)
```

watch a twitch stream in mpv with a bunch of extra audio filtering crap.

### [yt (sh/streamcrap)](/sh/streamcrap#L94)

watch a youtube video in mpv with a bunch of extra audio filtering crap.

remaining arguments are passed to mpv.

there exist several variants for more specific use cases.

watch a youtube video. like `yt`, but with a preference for different formats.

### [ytll (sh/streamcrap)](/sh/streamcrap#L113)

### [sum](/sh/sum#L6)

6
```

**TODO:** consider renaming because sum(1) already exists.

### [sv](/sh/sv#L6)

collect the lastmost value of every key.
the field separator can be given as its sole argument,
it defaults to a single space otherwise.

```
$ echo "alpha=first\nbeta=second\nalpha=third" | sv =
alpha=third
beta=second
```

this next example uses `sv` to only print the lastmost line
matching a pattern in each file. in other words, it uses
the filename printed by grep as the key in its key-value pairs.

```
$ cd ~/play/hash && grep -r 'ing$' . | sv :
./dic_win32.txt:WriteProfileString
./cracklib-small.txt:zoning
./english-words.txt:zooming
./usernames-125k.txt:flats_gaming

**TODO:** rename because wipe(1) already exists.

### [xxp](/sh/xxp#L6)

act like `xxd -p`, but nicely formatted.

**TODO:** support `-r` (reverse) argument.

```
